## Antipatterns 

• “Anti-patterns are certain patterns in software
development that are considered bad
programming practices.” <br />
• “As opposed to design patterns which are
common approaches to common problems
which have been formalized and are generally
considered a good development practice, antipatterns
are the opposite and are undesirable.”<br />
• Antipatterns are considered bad practices<br />
• They should be avoided <br />
• They normally make the code less readable and
maintainable<br />

### God Class and God Object
#### Defination 
• Breaks the Single Responsibility principle<br />
• This class or object is responsible for too many
things<br />
• For instance, user’s first name, last name, user id,
transaction id, a total sum of the transaction, list
of items a user is purchasing, etc.<br />

### Poltergeists 
#### Defination 
• “Is an anti-pattern involving a pointless class
that is used to call methods of another class
or simply adds an unnecessary layer of
abstraction”<br />
• “This anti-pattern manifests itself as short-lived
objects, devoid of state. These objects are
often used to initialize other, more
permanent objects”<br />
 <hr/>
 
 ### Hard coding
#### Defination 
• The problem with hard-coding is it makes the
program tightly coupled to certain
configuration or system<br />
• This complicates porting the application to
another configuration or system<br />
