## Creational Desing Patterns 

### Factory Design Pattern 
#### Uses 
• When a class can't anticipate which kind of
class of object it should create <br />
• When the classes to be created are derived
from the same superclass/interface  <br />
• When you want to insulate the client from the
actual type that is being instantiated <br />
