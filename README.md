## Behavioral Design Patterns 

### Factory Design Pattern 
#### Uses 
• When a class can't anticipate which kind of
class of object it should create <br />
• When the classes to be created are derived
from the same superclass/interface  <br />
• When you want to insulate the client from the
actual type that is being instantiated <br /> 
#### Examples 
java.util.Calendar,
java.util.ResourceBundle and
java.text.NumberFormat
#### DrawBacks
• Requires keeping factory methods in sync with
domain classes<br /> 
• No way to change an implementing class
without recompiling<br />
